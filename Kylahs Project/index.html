		wanted to create something that anyone can experience. All of the jewllery is hand made and pieced together 
		by Kylah. She is an aspiring entrepreneur that believes in a businesss that is able to make anyone and
		everyone feel so beautiful and confident! Orenda Originals is a great gift for any holiday, anniversary,
